# Display and Manage Datasets with OT CLI

Thread network configuration parameters are managed using Active and Pending
Operational Dataset objects. OT CLI includes commands to get and set Active
and Pending datasets.

## Active Operational Dataset

The Active Operational Dataset includes parameters that are currently in use
across an entire Thread network. The Active Operational Dataset contains:

*   Active Timestamp
*   Channel
*   Channel Mask
*   Extended PAN ID
*   Mesh-Local Prefix
*   Network Name
*   PAN ID
*   PSKc
*   Security Policy

To easily configure a device so that it's a full member of the Thread network, you
can use the [dataset active -x](/reference/cli/commands#dataset_active) command to
get a hex-encoded TLV, and the
[dataset set active](/reference/cli/commands#dataset_set_activepending) command to
set the dataset on a new device.

On an existing device, get the hex-encoded TLV:

```
> dataset active -x
0e080000000000010000000300001035060004001fffe00208e227ac6a7f24052f0708fdb753eb517cb4d3051062b2442a928d9ea3b947a1618fc4085a030f4f70656e5468726561642d393837330102987304105330d857354330133c05e1fd7ae81a910c0402a0f7f8
Done
```

On a new device, set the active dataset:

```
> dataset set active 0e080000000000010000000300001035060004001fffe00208e227ac6a7f24052f0708fdb753eb517cb4d3051062b2442a928d9ea3b947a1618fc4085a030f4f70656e5468726561642d393837330102987304105330d857354330133c05e1fd7ae81a910c0402a0f7f8
Done
```

## Pending Operational Dataset

The Pending Operational Dataset is used to communicate changes to the Active
Operational Dataset before they take effect. The Pending Operational Dataset
contains all the parameters from the Active Operational Dataset, with the
addition of:

- Delay Timer
- Pending Timestamp

## Get started

To manage datasets from the command line, complete our Simulation Codelab with
Docker and review the CLI Command Reference.

For a list of `dataset` commands, type `help`:

```
> dataset help

securitypolicy
Done
```

## Argument mappings

### Security Policy

Security Policy commands use argument mappings to get and set
[otSecurityPolicy](https://openthread.io/reference/struct/ot-security-policy)
members. For example, `dataset active`:

```
> dataset active
Active Timestamp: 1
Channel: 13
Channel Mask: 0x07fff800
Ext PAN ID: d63e8e3e495ebbc3
Mesh Local Prefix: fd3d:b50b:f96d:722d::/64
Network Key: dfd34f0f05cad978ec4e32b0413038ff
Network Name: OpenThread-8f28
PAN ID: 0x8f28
PSKc: c23a76e98f1a6483639b1ac1271e2e27
Security Policy: 0, onrcb
Done
```

In this example, `Security Policy: 0` indicates [mRotationTime](https://openthread.io/reference/struct/ot-security-policy#mrotationtime).

Here's a list of all of the Security Policy CLI arguments and
the corresponding `otSecurityPolicy` member for each argument:

*   `o`: [mObtainNetworkKeyEnabled](https://openthread.io/reference/struct/ot-security-policy#mobtainnetworkkeyenabled)
*   `n`: [mNativeCommissioningEnabled](https://openthread.io/reference/struct/ot-security-policy#mnativecommissioningenabled)
*   `r`: [mRoutersEnabled](https://openthread.io/reference/struct/ot-security-policy#mroutersenabled)
*   `c`: [mExternalCommissioningEnabled](https://openthread.io/reference/struct/ot-security-policy#mexternalcommissioningenabled)
*   `b`: [mBeaconsEnabled](https://openthread.io/reference/struct/ot-security-policy#mbeaconsenabled)
*   `C`: [mCommercialCommissioningEnabled](https://openthread.io/reference/struct/ot-security-policy#mcommercialcommissioningenabled)
*   `e`: [mAutonomousEnrollmentEnabled](https://openthread.io/reference/struct/ot-security-policy#mautonomousenrollmentenabled)
*   `p`: [mNetworkKeyProvisioningEnabled](https://openthread.io/reference/struct/ot-security-policy#mnetworkkeyprovisioningenabled)
*   `R`: [mNonCcmRoutersEnabled](https://openthread.io/reference/struct/ot-security-policy#mnonccmroutersenabled)

The `dataset securitypolicy` get and set commands also use the same argument
mappings, for example setting the `securitypolicy` and passing `o`, `n`, `r`,
and `c`:

```
> dataset securitypolicy 672 onrc
Done
```

### Dataset components and `mgmt` commands

Along with other parameters, the `mgmtgetcommand` and `mgmtsetcommand`
for Active and Pending Datasets allow you to get and set any combination
of [otOperationalDatasetComponents](https://openthread.io/reference/struct/ot-operational-dataset-components):

*   `activetimestamp`
*   `pendingtimestamp`
*   `networkkey`
*   `networkname`
*   `extpanid`
*   `localprefix`
*   `delaytimer`
*   `panid`
*   `channel`
*   `securitypolicy`

> Note: These commands are primarily used for testing only.

For the `mgmtgetcommand`, you can specify these components in any order to get
the corresponding values. Optionally, you can also pass `-x` to use a hex
string that's treated as a byte sequence representation of TLVs. This can be vendor
specific TLVs that you might want to add in addition to other parameters.

`mgmtgetcommand` also allows you to optionally specify the IPv6 address of
the leader. Otherwise, the leader ALOC is used.

<pre>dataset mgmtgetcommand {active|pending} [address <var>leader-address</var>] [<var>dataset-components</var>] [-x <var>tlv-list</var>]</pre>

For example, to get `activetimestamp` and `securitypolicy`, use the following
arguments:

```
> dataset mgmtgetcommand active address fdde:ad00:beef:0:558:f56b:d688:799 activetimestamp securitypolicy
Done
```

> Note: `mgmtgetcommand` will not output a response to the CLI. Instead, you can
observe the output response from a packet sniffer.

To set components, you can also supply the dataset components in any order,
followed by the component value.

<pre>dataset mgmtgetcommand {active|pending} [<var>dataset-components</var>] [-x <var>tlv-list</var>]</pre>

To set the `activetimestamp` and `securitypolicy`, use the following
arguments:

```
> dataset mgmtsetcommand active activetimestamp 123 securitypolicy 1 onrc
Done
```

# Install Pyspinel

Your installation options depend on how you use Pyspinel.

[Extcap](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/extcap.html) is a plugin for Wireshark that allows
it to use the Pyspinel binary as a capture interface. Extcap reduces the setup
and configuration needed to sniff Thread packets using Wireshark, as it does not
require writing to a capture file. With this option, configurations are managed and
saved in Wireshark, for example setting your Thread channel and selecting your RCP
or NCP device path from the GUI.

You can also use Wireshark without the extcap plugin. This option provides
command line access to [Pyspinel flags](https://github.com/openthread/pyspinel/tree/master/SNIFFER.md), allowing you to run the sniffer with
various configurations. You can set these flags every time you run the sniffer,
for example, `--channel 15 --uart /dev/ttyACM0`.

the latest Pyspinel main.

```
$ pip3 install --user pyspinel

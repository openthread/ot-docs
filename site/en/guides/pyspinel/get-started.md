# Get Started

The quickest way to get started with Pyspinel is to try out the CLI:

1.  First, [Install Pyspinel and dependencies without extcap](install-pyspinel.md).
1.  Directly on your machine, clone and build a simulated OpenThread NCP as
    described in [How to build OpenThread](../build/index.md#how_to_build_openthread). After cloning and
    bootstraping, build the sim example:

    ```
    $ ./script/cmake-build simulation
    ```

1.  Run the Pyspinel CLI, using the path to your simulated build:

    ```
    $ cd {path-to-pyspinel}
    $ spinel-cli.py -p {path-to-openthread}/build/simulation/examples/apps/ncp/ot-ncp-ftd -n 1
    spinel-cli > 
    ```

1.  Verify the OpenThread version:

    ```
    spinel-cli > version
    OPENTHREAD/thread-reference-20200818-1938-g0f10480ed; SIMULATION; Aug 30 2022 10:53:44
    Done
    ```

1.  Start Thread on the simulated NCP and verify that it has become the leader
    in a Thread network:

    ```
    spinel-cli > panid 1234
    Done
    spinel-cli > ifconfig up
    Done
    spinel-cli > thread start
    Done
    spinel-cli > state
    leader
    Done
    ```

1.  View the help menu to see what commands are available:

    ```
    spinel-cli > help
    ```

# Get Started

## Learn about Thread

Are you new to Thread<sup>Â®</sup>? Or simply need to refresh your knowledge?
Check out our [Thread Primer](thread-primer/index.md), which covers all the
basics of Thread and how it works.

## Try OpenThread

Want to see what OpenThread released by Google is all about? The quickest way to
do so is to run through one of our Codelabs or Guides.

### Simulation Codelab with Docker

Try OpenThread without the need for test hardware. Using Docker on a Mac or
Linux machine, learn how to:

*   Simulate a Thread network
*   Authenticate Thread nodes with Commissioning
*   Use OpenThread Daemon to manage a simulated Thread network featuring an RCP

  Docker</a>

### Simulation Codelab with build toolchain

An alternate version of the Docker Simulation Codelab, where instead of using
Docker, you set up the OpenThread build toolchain and build OpenThread directly
on a Mac or Linux machine.

  with build toolchain</a>

### Hardware Codelabs

Dive right into hardware, where you will learn how to:

*   Flash OpenThread on Nordic nRF52840 or Silicon Labs EFR32 development boards
*   Build a real Thread network
*   Authenticate Thread nodes with Commissioning
*   Use the OpenThread CLI for Multicast and UDP (Nordic only)

    Codelab</a>

### API Codelab

Want to use OpenThread APIs in an application? Using real hardware, learn how
to:

*   Program the buttons and LEDs on Nordic nRF52840 development boards
*   Use common OpenThread APIs and the `otInstance` class
*   Monitor and react to OpenThread state changes
*   Send UDP messages to all devices in a Thread network

   href="https://openthread.io/codelabs/openthread-apis/">Try the API Codelab</a>

### Network Simulator Codelab

OpenThread Network Simulator (OTNS) allows you to visualize and operate a
simulated Thread network, using a CLI and web interface. With a Mac or Linux
machine, learn how to:

*   Install OTNS and build OpenThread for OTNS
*   Use OTNS-Web to manage a Thread network and visualize activity in a web
    browser
*   Use OTNS-CLI to further control the simulation

  Codelab</a>

### Testing and Visualization Codelab

OTNS can be used with [Silk](https://github.com/openthread/silk), a fully automated test
platform for validating OpenThread function, feature, and system performance
with real devices. With a Mac or Linux machine, learn how to:

*   Build OpenThread for real devices with the OTNS feature enabled
*   Use OTNS-Web to monitor the status of the Thread network formed by running
    Silk test cases

  Visualization Codelab</a>

### Border Router Codelab

A Thread Border Router connects a Thread network to other IP-based networks,
such as Wi-Fi or Ethernet. A Thread network requires a Border Router to connect
to other networks. OpenThread Border Router (OTBR) is an open-source
implementation of a Thread Border Router.

With a Mac or Linux machine, learn how to:

*   Set up OTBR and form a Thread network
*   Build an OpenThread CLI device with the SRP feature
*   Register a service with SRP
*   Discover and reach a Thread end device

  Codelab</a>

### Border Router Thread 1.2 Multicast Codelab

Thread 1.2 introduces Multicast across Thread Networks, allowing multicast
communication between Thread network and Infrastructure (Wi-Fi/ethernet)
network segments. With a Mac or Linux machine and a Raspberry Pi, learn how to:

*   Build nRF52840 firmware with Thread 1.2 Multicast features
*   Subscribe to IPv6 multicast addresses on Thread devices

<a class="button button-primary"
   href="https://openthread.io/codelabs/openthread-border-router-ipv6-multicast/">Try the Border
  Router Thread 1.2 Multicast Codelab</a>

### Border Router NAT64 Codelab

NAT64 is a mechanism that enables hosts in IPv6-only networks to access
resources in IPv4 networks. The NAT64 gateway is a translator between IPv4
protocols and IPv6 protocols. With a Mac or Linux machine and a Raspberry Pi,
and building off the Border Router Codelab, learn how to:

*   Build an OpenThread Border Router with NAT64 features
*   Communicate with IPv4 hosts from Thread end devices

<a class="button button-primary"
   href="https://openthread.io/codelabs/openthread-border-router-nat64/">Try the Border
  Router NAT64 Codelab</a>

### Border Router with Docker

You can also run OTBR in a Docker container on any Linux-based machine.

  OTBR Docker guide</a>

## Get the code

Already know what you're doing and want to get started with the code? Visit the
[OpenThread GitHub site](https://github.com/openthread/openthread), where you can
find the OpenThread repository, along with other support repositories, like
OpenThread Border Router, OpenThread RTOS, and OpenThread Commissioner.

## Platform support

OpenThread has been ported to several devices and platforms by both the
OpenThread team, silicon vendors, and the community.

See the list of vendor-supported platforms at [Vendor Support](https://openthread.io/vendors).

Learn more about the system architecture and platform designs on the
[Platforms](https://openthread.io/platforms/) overview.

## Docker support

Docker images for use with OpenThread are available on [Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openthread/). These images are created and tested
by the OpenThread team, and are an easy way to get started with OpenThread
without having to go through toolchain and system configuration.

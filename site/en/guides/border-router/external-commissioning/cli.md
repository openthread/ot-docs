#  OT Commissioner CLI

External commissioning is supported by the OT Commissioner CLI, available
on the [ot-commissioner GitHub repository](https://github.com/openthread/ot-commissioner). For
instructions on how to build and install OT Commissioner, refer to [OT Commissioner Build and
Configuration](../../commissioner/build.md).

> Note: OT Commissioner must be running on the same host machine as OTBR.

## Connect to the Border Router

1.  Open the Non-CCM configuration file located at
    `/usr/local/etc/commissioner/non-ccm-config.json` and change the `PSKc` to
    `198886f519a8fd7c981fee95d72f4ba7`:

    ```
    "PSKc" : "198886f519a8fd7c981fee95d72f4ba7"
    ```

1.  Start the OT Commissioner CLI with the Non-CCM configuration:

    ```
    $ commissioner-cli /usr/local/etc/commissioner/non-ccm-config.json
    > 
    ```

1.  Connect to OTBR:

    ```
    > start :: 49191
    [done]
    > 
    ```

1.  Verify that the Commissioner is active:

    ```
    > active
    true
    [done]
    > 
    ```

## Commission the Joiner

Once connected to the Border Router, OT Commissioner can commission the Joiner
device.

1.  In OT Commissioner, enable Thread MeshCoP joiner for all Joiners with a
    password of `J01NU5`:
    ```
    > joiner enableall meshcop J01NU5
    [done]
    > 
    ```

1.  On the Joiner device, start the Joiner role with the password configured in
    OT Commissioner:
    ```
    > ifconfig up
    Done
    > joiner start J01NU5
    Done
    ```

1.  Wait a minute for the DTLS handshake to complete between the Commissioner
    and Joiner:
    ```
    > 
    Join success!
    ```

## Join the Thread network

Next, on the Joiner device, [join the Thread network](join.md) and test network connectivity.

# OT Commissioner CLI

External commissioning is supported by the OT Commissioner CLI, available
on the [ot-commissioner GitHub repository](https://github.com/openthread/ot-commissioner).

In this guide, you'll build and install OT Commissioner and commission a Joiner.

## Set up OT Commissioner

To use OT Commissioner CLI, first [Build OT Commissioner](../../commissioner/build.md).

## Discover your network

To start OT Commissioner, you'll need to find the IP address and port number of
your border agent service. For help on locating this information, refer to
[mDNS Discovery](../mdns-discovery.md). The Border Agent supports both IPv4 and
IPv6 connections.

> Note: To support multiple Thread interfaces on a single host, the border agent
service uses an ephemeral port by default. This means that your port number
might change when you restart `otbr-agent` or your OTBR platform.

## Connect to the Border Router

1.  Start the OT Commissioner CLI:

    ```
    $ commissioner-cli
    > 
    ```

1.  Set your PSKc:

    ```
    > config set pskc 198886f519a8fd7c981fee95d72f4ba7
    [done]
    ```

1.  Connect to OTBR, providing your mDNS IP address and port:

    ```
    > start FD00::74D0:6FC9:6BE6:3582 49155
    [done]
    >
    ```

1.  Verify that the Commissioner is active:

    ```
    > active
    true
    [done]
    > 
    ```

## Commission the Joiner

Once connected to the Border Router, OT Commissioner can commission the Joiner
device.

1.  In OT Commissioner, enable Thread MeshCoP joiner for all Joiners with a
    password of `J01NU5`:
    ```
    > joiner enableall meshcop J01NU5
    [done]
    > 
    ```

1.  On the Joiner device, start the Joiner role with the password configured in
    OT Commissioner:
    ```
    > ifconfig up
    Done
    > joiner start J01NU5
    Done
    ```

1.  Wait a minute for the DTLS handshake to complete between the Commissioner
    and Joiner:
    ```
    > 
    Join success!
    ```

## Join the Thread network

Next, on the Joiner device, [join the Thread network](join.md) and test network
connectivity.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having issues with OT Commissioner, check the `commissioner.log`,
if available. To configure logging, refer to [Build OT Commissioner](../../commissioner/build.md).

**IO_ERROR: connect socket to peer addr**

Try using a different IP address to start OT Commissioner.

**IO_ERROR: NET - Reading information from the socket failed**

The socket APIs return this error message when a call to bind or connect to OTBR
fails. If you're receiving this error message, try the following:

*   Make sure that you're passing the correct port number when you start OT
    Commissioner. OTBR may use a different port after it's restarted or you
    reboot your platform.
*   Make sure that OTBR is running and that your Thread network is properly
    configured, including your PSKc. Your Passphrase/Commissioner Credential
    must be a string between 6 and 255 characters.
*   Check your global IP addresses, for example `ifconfig eth0`. You may be
    using the wrong IP address to start OT Commissioner.

**SECURITY: SSL - A fatal alert message was received from our peer**

OT Commissioner establishes a secure DTLS session with the border agent service.
A fatal SSL error typically indicates that the secure DTLS session fails.

If you receive this message, check your PSKc.

From OTBR:

```
$ sudo ot-ctl pskc
198886f519a8fd7c981fee95d72f4ba7
Done
```

From OT Commissioner:

```
> config get pskc
198886f519a8fd7c981fee95d72f4ba7
[done]
```

OpenThread Border Router (OTBR) features a Thread Border Agent, which supports
external Thread Commissioning. In external Thread Commissioning, a device
outside of the Thread network (for example, a mobile phone) commissions new
devices onto the network.

The Thread Commissioner serves to authenticate a user (external Commissioner) or
a Thread device onto the Thread network. After authentication, the Commissioner
instructs the Border Router to transfer Thread network credentials, such as the
network key, to the device directly.

This is an example of in-band commissioning, where Thread network credentials
are transferred between devices over the radio.

> Key Point: During commissioning, the Thread Commissioner never gains possession
of the network key.

This guide details how to commission an OpenThread device onto a network created
and managed by the OTBR Web GUI.

To learn how to commission without an external Commissioner, see
[On-Mesh Commissioning](../../build/commissioning.md).

# External Commissioning for Android

External commissioning is supported by the OT Commissioner Android App, available
on the [ot-commissioner GitHub repository](https://github.com/openthread/ot-commissioner/tree/master/android). Follow the instructions
in the README to build and install the app on an Android device.

To use the Thread 1.1 Commissioning App, refer to [Thread Group Android App](#thread-group-android-app).

> Note: The OT Commissioner Android App is only available for Android.

## OT Commissioner Android App

### Connect to the Border Router

1.  With both devices on the same network, connect the device with the OT
    Commissioner Android App to the Border Router.
1.  Open the OT Commissioner Android App and select the desired Border
    Router from the available list. The name is the same as the Thread network
    created by the OTBR Web GUI.

    </figure>

1.  Enter the Passphrase (Commissioner Credential) set in the OTBR Web GUI (and
    used to generate the PSKc) when prompted for a password.

### Commission the Joiner

Once connected to the Border Router, the app provides the option to scan a
Connect QR Code. Thread QR Codes are created with the following text
string format:

<pre>v=1&&eui=0000b57fffe15d68&&cc=J01NU5</pre>

Where `eui` is the Joiner device's EUI64 value and `cc` is the Joiner
Credential. Use this text string with an online QR Code generator to create a QR
Code for scanning. For help on finding your `eui` and creating a Joiner
Credential, refer to [Prepare the Joiner device](prepare.md).

1.  In the OT Commissioner Android App, click **Add Device**.
1.  Scan the Connect QR Code of the Joiner device. This generates the
    PSKd, propagates the steering data through the Thread network, and
    establishes a DTLS session.

    </figure>

1.  While the app is waiting, enter the OpenThread CLI on the Joiner device and
    start the Joiner role with that same Joiner Credential:
    ```
    > ifconfig up
    Done
    > joiner start J01NU5
    Done
    ```

1.  Wait a minute for the DTLS handshake to complete between the Commissioner
    and Joiner:
    ```
    > 
    Join success!
    ```

1.  The OT Commissioner Android App also updates with an "Commission Succeed"
    confirmation message.

The Joiner has obtained the Thread network credentials, and can now join the
network.

## Thread Group Android App

Thread 1.1 external commissioning is supported by the [Thread 1.1 Commissioning App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.threadgroup.commissioner&hl=en), available for download at the Google
Play Store for Android devices.

> Note: The Thread 1.1 Commissioning App is only available for Android.

### Connect to the Border Router

1.  With both devices on the same network, connect the device with the
    Thread Group Android App to the Border Router.
1.  Open the Thread Group Android App and select the desired Border
    Router from the available list. The name is the same as the Thread network
    created by the OTBR Web GUI.

    <img src="../../images/thread-app-border-router.png" width="200" border="0" class="screenshot" alt="Thread 1.1 App Border Router" /></a>
    </figure>

1.  Enter the Passphrase (Commissioner Credential) set in the OTBR Web GUI (and
    used to generate the PSKc) when prompted for a password.

### Commission the Joiner

Once connected to the Border Router, the app provides the option to scan a
Connect QR Code or enter a Join Passphrase manually. Thread Connect QR Codes are
created with the following text string format:

<pre>v=1&&eui=0000b57fffe15d68&&cc=J01NU5</pre>

Where `eui` is the Joiner device's EUI64 value and `cc` is the Joiner
Credential. Use this text string with an online QR Code generator to create a QR
Code for scanning. For help on finding your `eui` and creating a Joiner
Credential, refer to [Prepare the Joiner device](prepare.md).

1.  In the Thread Group Android App, scan the Connect QR Code of the Joiner
    device, or enter the EUI64 and Joiner Credential manually. This generates
    the PSKd, propagates the steering data through the Thread network, and
    establishes a DTLS session.

1.  While the app is waiting, enter the OpenThread CLI on the Joiner device and
    start the Joiner role with that same Joiner Credential:
    ```
    > ifconfig up
    Done
    > joiner start J01NU5
    Done
    ```

1.  Wait a minute for the DTLS handshake to complete between the Commissioner
    and Joiner:
    ```
    > 
    Join success!
    ```

1.  The Thread Group Android App also updates with an "Added My Thread Product"
    confirmation message.

The Joiner has obtained the Thread network credentials, and can now join the
network.

### Thread Commissioning App troubleshooting

You may encounter issues with the Thread Commissioning App, due to changed or
stale network information. The app retains OTBR network information locally and
does not always prompt for updates.

To resolve these issues, delete all local application data, restart the app, and
try the commissioning process again.

To delete local application data:

1.  On the Android device, open the Settings app
1.  Go to **Apps & notifications** > **App info** > **Thread** > **Storage**
1.  Select **CLEAR DATA**
1.  Go back to **App info** and select **FORCE STOP**
1.  Close the Settings app and restart the Thread app

## Join the Thread network

Next, on the Joiner device, [join the Thread network](join.md) and test network connectivity.

# OpenThread Border Router

A Thread Border Router connects a Thread network to other IP-based networks,
such as Wi-Fi or Ethernet. A Thread network requires a Border Router to connect
to other networks.

A Thread Border Router minimally supports the following functions:

*   Bidirectional IP connectivity between Thread and Wi-Fi/Ethernet networks.
*   Bidirectional service discovery via mDNS (on a Wi-Fi/Ethernet link) and SRP
    (on a Thread network).
*   Thread-over-infrastructure that merges Thread partitions over IP-based
    links.
*   External Thread Commissioning (for example, a mobile phone) to authenticate
    and join a Thread device to a Thread network.

OpenThread's implementation of a Border Router is called OpenThread Border
Router (OTBR). OTBR is a Thread Certified Component on the [Raspberry Pi
3B](raspberry-pi.md) with a [Nordic
nRF52840](https://openthread.io/vendors/nordic-semiconductor) NCP.

## Get started

### Docker

The quickest way to get started with OTBR is to try the Docker version. Run OTBR
in a Docker container on any Linux-based system or a Raspberry Pi 3B or newer,
using either a physical or simulated RCP.

See the [Docker Support Overview](docker/index.md) for more
information.

### Codelabs

To set up an OTBR without Docker, try one of our Border Router codelabs. Run
OTBR on a Raspberry Pi 3B or 4, using physical RCPs.

### Platforms

OTBR also runs directly on a supported platform:

1.  Choose a platform:
    *   [BeagleBone Black](beaglebone-black.md)
    *   [Raspberry Pi 3B or newer](raspberry-pi.md)
1.  [Build and configure OTBR](build.md)
1.  Learn about [tools and scripts included with
    OTBR](tools.md)

### Get the code

To go straight to the source code, see the
[OpenThread Border Router GitHub repository](https://github.com/openthread/ot-br-posix).

You can contribute to the ongoing development of OpenThread Border Router by
submitting bug reports and feature requests to the [Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/openthread/ot-br-posix/issues).

### Community projects

> Note: Projects listed here are not officially supported by the OpenThread team.

#### QEMU OTBR

A member of the OT community has enabled [OTBR support using
QEMU](https://github.com/ERNE196077/qemu_openthread_borderrouter), an
open-source machine emulator and virtualizer. The project emulates Raspbian on
an ARM architecture.

## Features and services

OTBR includes a number of features, including:

*   [Web GUI](https://openthread.io/guides/border-router/web-gui) for configuration and management
*   Thread Border Agent to support [external
    commissioning](https://openthread.io/guides/border-router/external-commissioning)
*   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation to obtain IPv6 prefixes for a Thread network
*   NAT64 for connecting to IPv4 networks
*   DNS64 to allow Thread devices to initiate communications by name to an
    IPv4-only server
*   Thread interface driver using OpenThread's built-in feature
*   [Docker support](docker/index.md)

### Border Router services

OTBR provides the following services:

*   mDNS Publisher — Allows an External Commissioner to discover an OTBR and its
    associated Thread network
*   [PSKc Generator](tools.md) — For generation of PSKc keys
*   Web Service — Web UI for management of a Thread network

Third-party components for Border Router Services include Simple Web Server and
Material Design Lite for the framework of the web UI.

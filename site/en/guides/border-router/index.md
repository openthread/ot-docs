# OpenThread Border Router

A Thread Border Router connects a Thread network to other IP-based networks,
such as Wi-Fi or Ethernet. A Thread network requires a Border Router to connect
to other networks.

A Thread Border Router minimally supports the following functions:

*   Bidirectional IP connectivity between Thread and Wi-Fi/Ethernet networks.
*   Bidirectional service discovery via mDNS (on a Wi-Fi/Ethernet link) and SRP
    (on a Thread network).
*   Thread-over-infrastructure that merges Thread partitions over IP-based
    links.
*   External Thread Commissioning (for example, a mobile phone) to authenticate
    and join a Thread device to a Thread network.

OpenThread's implementation of a Border Router is called OpenThread Border
Router (OTBR), supporting a [Radio Co-Processor (RCP) design](https://openthread.io/platforms/co-processor).
When choosing your platform, consider the following benefits of using RCP:

*   More resources: OpenThread can take advantage of the host processor's
    resources, which is typically much more than what an 802.15.4 SoC provides.
*   More cost effective: minimize resource requirements on the 802.15.4 SoC,
    which can lead to a more cost-effective solution.
*   Easier to debug: since most of the processing happens on the host processor,
    you can utilize more capable debugging tools on the host processor.
*   More stable 802.15.4 SoC firmware: the RCP only implements the sub-MAC and
    PHY, reducing the frequency at which the 802.15.4 SoC needs firmware
    updates.
*   Easier integration with host IPv6 network stack: having OpenThread run on
    the host allows for more direct integration with the host IPv6 stack.

> Note: OTBR is also a Thread Certified Component on the [Raspberry Pi
3B](raspberry-pi.md) with a [Nordic
nRF52840](https://openthread.io/vendors/nordic-semiconductor) NCP.

## Features and services

OTBR includes a number of features, including:

*   [Web GUI](web-gui.md) for configuration and management
*   Thread Border Agent to support [external
    commissioning](external-commissioning/index.md)
*   DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation to obtain IPv6 prefixes for a Thread network
*   NAT64 for connecting to IPv4 networks
*   DNS64 to allow Thread devices to initiate communications by name to an
    IPv4-only server
*   Thread interface driver using OpenThread's built-in feature
*   [Docker support](docker/index.md)

### Border Router services

OTBR provides the following services:

*   [mDNS Publisher](mdns-discovery.md) — Allows an External Commissioner to discover an OTBR and its
    associated Thread network
*   [PSKc Generator](tools.md) — For generation of PSKc keys
*   Web Service — [Web UI](web-gui.md) for management of a Thread network

Third-party components for Border Router Services include Simple Web Server and
Material Design Lite for the framework of the web UI.

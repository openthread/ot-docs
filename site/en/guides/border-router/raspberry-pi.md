# Raspberry Pi

OpenThread Border Router (OTBR) provides support for the [Raspberry Pi
3B or newer](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products) (RPi)
platform.

Hardware requirements:

*   External 5V AC adapter for power
*   A supported [OpenThread platform](https://openthread.io/platforms) for Thread network
    connectivity in an RCP design
*   A microSD card and microSD card reader ("SD card" in this guide)

Access the RPi with an external monitor (via HDMI) and keyboard (via USB), or
connect a [serial cable](../../guides/border-router/serial-cables.md) from the RPi to
your computer and enable the serial console.

To use RPi with OTBR:

1.  [Download and install the OS](#download-and-install-the-os).
1.  [Build and install OTBR](build.md).

## Step 1: Download and install the OS

The RPi does not include any on-board flash memory, and requires an SD card
with a bootable image to operate.

1.  Download the [Raspberry Pi OS Lite
    image](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/)
    to a local machine with a built-in or external SD card reader.
    *   If using [OTBR Docker](docker/index.md) on the RPi,
        download [Raspberry Pi OS with
        Desktop](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/)
        instead.
1.  Install the OS image on an SD card:
    *   [Linux](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md)
    *   [Mac OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md)
    *   [Windows](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/windows.md)
1.  Insert the SD card with the Raspberry OS image into the RPi.
1.  Boot the RPi to go through the OS installation.

For more detailed information on setup and configuration, see the
[Raspberry Pi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/).

## Step 2: Build and install OTBR

See [Build and Configuration](build.md) for instructions on
building and installing OTBR.

# ESP Thread Border Router

ESP Thread border router is a FreeRTOS-based implementation running on a combination of Espressif's Wi-Fi and 802.15.4 SoCs.

Hardware requirements:

Espressif provides an [ESP Border Router Board](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/Thread_Border_Router_Certification) which integrates the host SoC (ESP32-S3) and the RCP (ESP32-H2) into one module.

You only need to connect the board to the ESP32-S3 (main SoC) port. The main SoC automatically programs the Thread co-processor.

## Step 1: Set up Repositories

To set up the environment, please follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32s3/get-started/index.html#installation-step-by-step).

Clone the [esp-idf](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) and the [esp-thread-br](https://github.com/espressif/esp-thread-br) repository.

```
$ git clone -b v5.1.2 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
$ cd esp-idf
$ ./install.sh
$ . ./export.sh
$ cd ..
$ git clone -b v1.0 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-thread-br.git
```

> Note: The `esp-thread-br` branch v1.0 with the `esp-idf` branch v5.1.2 is one of the release versions. For the latest version of `esp-thread-br`, please refer to [ESP Thread Border Router Codelab: 2.1.1. Set up the Repositories](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-thread-br/en/latest/dev-guide/build_and_run.html#set-up-the-repositories).

## Step 2: Configure the Thread and the Wi-Fi network

The border router will automatically join the Wi-Fi network and create a new Thread network if there is not one in its storage.
The network parameters can be configured in the config menu:

```
$ cd esp-thread-br/examples/basic_thread_border_router
$ idf.py menuconfig
```

The network configuration items are:

* Enable automatic start mode in Thread Border Router: **ESP Thread Border Router Example > Enable the automatic start mode in Thread Border Router.**
* Wi-Fi SSID and PSK: **Example Connection Configuration > connect using Wi-Fi interface**
* Thread network parameters: **Component config > OpenThread > Thread Operational Dataset**


## Step 3: Build and run the border router

Build the `esp-idf/examples/openthread/ot_rcp` example. The firmware doesn't need to be explicitly flashed to a device. It will be included in the Border Router firmware and flashed to the ESP32-H2 chip upon first boot (or the RCP firmware changed).
```
$ cd ${IDF_PATH}/examples/openthread/ot_rcp
$ idf.py set-target esp32h2
$ idf.py build
```

Then go back to the `basic_thread_border_router` example folder.
```
$ cd esp-thread-br/examples/basic_thread_border_router
$ idf.py set-target esp32s3
$ idf.py build
$ idf.py -p <your-local-port> flash monitor
```

Now you'll see the border router output in the ESP32S3 monitor. It also provides an interactive OpenThread command line:

```
> state
leader
Done
>
```

# OpenThread Border Router Build and Configuration

This guide covers the basic build and configuration of OpenThread Border Router
(OTBR). Upon completion of this procedure, you will have an OTBR that functions
as a Full Thread Device (FTD) in an RCP design.

## Step 1: Configure Platform

Configure a supported hardware platform:

*   [BeagleBone Black](beaglebone-black.md)
*   [Raspberry Pi](raspberry-pi.md)

## Step 2: Build and flash RCP

OTBR runs on an RCP design. Select a [supported OpenThread
platform](https://openthread.io/platforms/) to use as an RCP and follow the building and flashing
instructions for that platform.

For an overview of building OpenThread, see the
[Building Guide](../build/index.md).

Specific instructions on building supported platforms with GNU Autotools can be
found in each example's
[platform folder](https://github.com/openthread/openthread/tree/master/examples/platforms).

## Step 3: Install OTBR

> Warning: Before you continue, make sure your configured hardware platform
is connected to the internet using Ethernet. The `bootstrap` script disables
the platform's Wi-Fi interface and the `setup` script requires internet
connectivity to download and install several packages.

OTBR communicates with the RCP via spinel. To install OTBR on the configured
hardware platform, complete the following steps.

Clone the OTBR repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/openthread/ot-br-posix
```

### Install dependencies

The default configuration enables `BORDER_ROUTING` for most platforms. For a
complete list of OTBR default flags, refer to
[platform examples on GitHub](https://github.com/openthread/ot-br-posix/tree/main/examples/platforms).
Select your platform, then click `default`, if available.

*   Default usage:

    ```
    $ cd ot-br-posix
    $ ./script/bootstrap
    ```

*   [BeagleBone Black](beaglebone-black.md) with Network Manager (optional):

    ```
    $ cd ot-br-posix
    $ NETWORK_MANAGER=1 NETWORK_MANAGER_WIFI=1 ./script/bootstrap
    ```

### Compile and install OTBR

> Note: If you added or modified flags for the `bootstrap` script,
you'll need to make the same changes here.

*   Default usage. The setup script enables Border Routing by default. To enable
    Border Routing, specify your platform's Ethernet or Wi-Fi interface:

    Use Ethernet:

    ```
    $ INFRA_IF_NAME=eth0 ./script/setup
    ```

    Use Wi-Fi:

    ```
    $ INFRA_IF_NAME=wlan0 ./script/setup
    ```

*   [BeagleBone Black](beaglebone-black.md). Use Network Manager (optional):

    ```
    $ NETWORK_MANAGER=1 NETWORK_MANAGER_WIFI=1 ./script/setup
    ```

## Step 4: Attach and configure RCP device

Attach the flashed RCP device to the Border Router platform via USB.

> Caution: The Border Router with the RCP device attached must use an external
AC adapter of the proper voltage. Do not power the Border Router from a USB Hub
or a computer's USB port.

To configure the RCP device's serial port in `otbr-agent`, first, determine the
serial port name for the RCP device by checking `/dev`:

```
$ ls /dev/tty*
```

Next, check your `otbr-agent` settings.

```
$ cd /etc/default
$ cat otbr-agent
```

The `otbr-agent` configuration file contains your Thread interface name, Ethernet
or Wi-Fi interface name, and RCP serial port name.

<pre>OTBR_AGENT_OPTS="-I wpan0 -B OTBR_INFRA_IF_NAME spinel+hdlc+uart:///dev/ttyACM0 trel://OTBR_INFRA_IF_NAME"</pre>

Not all devices attach with the same serial port name. The most
common port names are `ttyACM*` and `ttyUSB*`. Refer to the documentation for
your device to determine the expected serial port name.

If required, update the `otbr-agent` configuration file. For example, for a Wi-Fi
interface and a serial port name of `ttyUSB0`:

```
OTBR_AGENT_OPTS="-I wpan0 -B wlan0 spinel+hdlc+uart:{///dev/ttyUSB0} trel://wlan0"
```

To update an Ethernet interface:

```
OTBR_AGENT_OPTS="-I wpan0 -B eth0 spinel+hdlc+uart:{///dev/ttyUSB0} trel://eth0"
```

Power cycle the Border Router. If using the BeagleBone Black platform,
remember to [hold down the BOOT button](beaglebone-black.md) while
doing so.

The OTBR service should start on boot.

## Step 5: Verify services

Verify that all required services are enabled:

```
$ sudo systemctl status
```

If the `setup` script was successful, the following services appear in the
output:

*   `mdns.service`
*   `otbr-agent.service`
*   `otbr-web.service`

For example:

```

               └─466 /sbin/dhcpcd -q -w
```

If those services are running, but the RPi is in a **degraded** state, some
other service has failed to start. Check to see which:

```
$ sudo systemctl --failed
```

You can also check each service individually:

```
$ sudo service mdns status
```

```
$ sudo service otbr-agent status
```

```
$ sudo service otbr-web status
```

`otbr-web` is enabled by default for most [platforms](https://github.com/openthread/ot-br-posix/tree/main/examples/platforms).
If `otbr-web` is not installed, try passing the `WEB_GUI` flag:

```
$ WEB_GUI=1 ./script/bootstrap
$ INFRA_IF_NAME=wlan0 WEB_GUI=1 ./script/setup
```

## Step 6: Verify RCP

Verify that the RCP is in the correct state:

```
$ sudo ot-ctl state
```

`ot-ctl` is a command line utility provided with OTBR. It is used to
communicate with the Thread PAN interface (default is `wpan0`) that `otbr-agent`
is bound to in the RCP design.

If the RCP is successfully running and the node is not a member of a Thread
network, the output should be similar to the below:

```
disabled
```

If the output is `OpenThread daemon is not running`, troubleshoot with the following:

1.  Verify the Border Router has sufficient power (use the proper external AC
    adapter).
1.  Disconnect and reconnect the RCP board to the Border Router platform.
1.  Verify that the RCP serial device is present. For example, if the device
    should be attached to `/dev/ttyUSB0`:

    ```
    $ ls /dev/ttyUSB*
    /dev/ttyUSB0
    ```

1.  Reset the RCP with `sudo ot-ctl reset`.

Check the RCP status again with `sudo ot-ctl state`.

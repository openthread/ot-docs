# OpenThread Border Router Web GUI

Use the OpenThread Border Router (OTBR) Web GUI to configure and form, join, or
check the status of a Thread network.

## Access the Web GUI

Access the Web GUI by visiting the OTBR's local IPv4 address in a browser
window. See the [Raspberry Pi IP Address page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ip-address.md) for more information.

## Join a Thread network

Use the **Join** menu option to scan for and join an existing Thread network.

## Form a Thread network

Use the **Form** menu option to create a new Thread network.

1.  Replace all default values on the Form page—except for the On-Mesh
    Prefix—to ensure a secure Thread network.
1.  Select **FORM**.
1.  After the network forms, confirm by checking the **Status** menu option.

Next, check the `wpan0` interface for the global IPv6 address with the On-Mesh
Prefix set during network formation:

<pre>
$ ifconfig wpan0
wpan0: flags=4305&lt;UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,NOARP,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1280
    inet6 fdde:ad11:11de:0:74d0:6fc9:6be6:3582  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0&lt;global&gt;
    inet6 fe80::287f:87ca:f4b3:498a  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20&lt;link&gt;
    inet6 fd11:22::287f:87ca:f4b3:498a  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0&lt;global&gt;
</pre>

The On-Mesh Prefix global address, for example **fd11:22::287f:87ca:f4b3:498a**, is used by
child nodes to identify the Border Router that is responsible for forwarding traffic out of
the network. The other addresses correspond to the [Mesh-Local and Link-Local IPv6 addresses](../thread-primer/ipv6-addressing.md)
of this node within the Thread network.

## Check the Status

The **Status** menu option displays status information for the Thread network.

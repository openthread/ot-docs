# OpenThread Border Router Setup

OpenThread Border Router (OTBR) currently offers support for both [Radio Co-processor (RCP)](/platforms/co-processor#radio_co-processor_rcp) and [Network Co-Processor (NCP)](/platforms/co-processor#network_co-processor_ncp) designs. You can select either design for your OTBR.

> Note: The NCP design is currently experimental and limited to Thread 1.3 features.

Upon completion of this procedure, you will have an OTBR that functions
as a Full Thread Device (FTD) in the design you chose.

## Step 1: What you'll need

* A Raspberry Pi for the Thread border router.
* 2 Nordic Semiconductor nRF52840 USB Dongles (one for the Co-Processor and one for the Thread end device).

## Step 2: Build and flash Co-Processor firmware

Follow the instructions based on the design you chose.

### RCP design

In RCP design, OTBR depends on an IEEE 802.15.4 radio to send/receive Thread messages.

Follow [step 4 of the *Build a Thread network with nRF52840 boards and OpenThread* codelab](https://openthread.io/codelabs/openthread-hardware#3) to build and flash a nRF52840 RCP device.

### NCP design

In NCP design, the full Thread stack runs on the 802.15.4 radio chip.

Follow the instructions below to build the NCP firmware from the [`ot-nrf528xx`](https://github.com/openthread/ot-nrf528xx) repository you cloned in the previous step:

```
$ script/build nrf52840 USB_trans \
    -DOT_THREAD_VERSION=1.3 \
    -DOT_APP_CLI=OFF \
    -DOT_APP_RCP=OFF \
    -DOT_RCP=OFF \
    -DOT_MTD=OFF \
    -DOT_BORDER_ROUTER=ON \
    -DOT_BORDER_ROUTING=ON \
    -DOT_NCP_INFRA_IF=ON \
    -DOT_SRP_SERVER=ON \
    -DOT_SRP_ADV_PROXY=ON \
    -DOT_PLATFORM_DNSSD=ON \
    -DOT_NCP_DNSSD=ON \
    -DOT_ECDSA=ON \
    -DOT_SERVICE=ON \
    -DOT_BACKBONE_ROUTER=ON \
    -DOT_BACKBONE_ROUTER_MULTICAST_ROUTING=ON \
    -DOT_NCP_CLI_STREAM=ON
```

Then follow the same steps as RCP design to convert the firmware into hex format and flash.

## Step 3: Prepare Raspberry Pi

1.  Install [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/) on the
    RPi. Both Desktop and Lite versions will work.

1.  Once installed, boot up the RPi and open a terminal window and update the system:
    ```
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get upgrade
    ```

## Step 4: Attach the Co-Processor

1.  Attach the Co-Processor device to the Raspberry Pi.

1.  Determine the serial port name for the Co-Processor device by checking `/dev`:
    ```
    $ ls /dev/tty*
    /dev/ttyACMO
    ```

## Step 5: Install OTBR on Raspberry Pi

> Note: The quickest way to set up an OTBR is by using Docker.

To install OTBR using Docker, follow the [OTBR Docker Install guide](https://openthread.io/guides/border-router/build-docker).
    
To install OTBR natively on Linux host, follow the [OTBR Native Install guide](https://openthread.io/guides/border-router/build-native).

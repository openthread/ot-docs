# Tools and Scripts

OpenThread Border Router (OTBR) includes a variety of tools and scripts that can
be used for testing purposes.

## PSKc generator

`pskc` generates a Pre-Shared Key for the Commissioner (PSKc). The
PSKc is used to authenticate an external Thread Commissioner to a Thread
network. Build and install OTBR to use this tool.

After building, `pskc` is located at
[`/ot-br-posix/tools`](https://github.com/openthread/ot-br-posix/tree/main/tools/README.md).

### Parameters

The PSKc is generated from the following parameters:

*   Commissioner Credential
*   Thread Network Extended PAN ID
*   Thread Network Name

> Note: The Commissioner Credential is a user-defined string between 6 and 255 characters, UTF-8 encoded.
  
### Usage

Syntax:

```
pskc {commissioner-credential} {extpanid} {network-name}
```

Example:

```
$ ./pskc J01NME 1234AAAA1234BBBB MyOTBRNetwork
ee4fb64e9341e13846bbe7e1c52b6785
```

See [External Thread
Commissioning](../../guides/border-router/external-commissioning.md#manual) for how to
use this tool with `ot-ctl`.

## Steering data generator

`steering-data` uses a Bloom filter to generate a hash of the set of Joiners
intended for commissioning. During commissioning, the Joiner only looks for
networks advertising steering data that includes the Joiner itself. Build and
install OTBR to use this tool.

After building, `steering-data` is located at
[`/ot-br-posix/tools`](https://github.com/openthread/ot-br-posix/tree/main/tools/README.md).

### Parameters

The steering data is generated from the following parameters:

*   Joiner ID (EUI-64)
*   Byte length of steering data (optional, default is 16)

### Usage

Syntax:

```
steering-data [{length}] {joiner-id}
```

Example:

```
$ ./steering-data 0000b57fffe15d68
00000000000000000020000000000100
```

Use multiple Joiner IDs to include them all in the steering data:

```
$ ./steering-data 0000b57fffe15d68 0000c57fffe15d68
00000000000080000020000000000500
```

Use the `length` parameter to change the byte length of the resulting steering
data:

```
$ ./steering-data 8 0000b57fffe15d68
0020000000000100
```

## OTBR commissioner

Use `otbr-commissioner` to commission a Thread device from the command line.
This tool is used in MeshCop (Mesh Commissioning Protocol) tests during
continuous integration. Build and install OTBR to use this tool.

After building, `otbr-commissioner` is located at
[`/src/commissioner`](https://github.com/openthread/ot-br-posix/tree/main/src/commissioner).

### Parameters

To successfully commissioner a Thread device with `otbr-commissioner`, we
suggest using the following parameters at a minimum:

<table class="details responsive">
  <thead>
    <th colspan="2">Parameters</th>
  </thead>
        <tbody>

### Usage

```
$ ./otbr-commissioner --network-name MyOTBRNetwork --network-password J01NME --xpanid 1234AAAA1234BBBB --joiner-eui64 0000b57fffe15d68 --joiner-pskd J01NU5 --agent-host 192.168.1.2 --agent-port 49191
```

For a shell script example, see the
[`meshcop` test script](https://github.com/openthread/ot-br-posix/tree/main/tests/scripts/meshcop).

## standalone_ipv6 script

Use the `standalone_ipv6` script to test IPv6 functionality if your test or
development environment does not have a full IPv6 infrastructure available (for
example, if your network is not connected to an upstream IPv6 provider).

This script installs extra features on the platform running OTBR to enable the
device to serve IPv6 addresses.

This script is located at [`/ot-br-posix/script/standalone_ipv6`](https://github.com/openthread/ot-br-posix/tree/main/script/standalone_ipv6).
